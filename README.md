# IMPORTANT NOTICE

The new version is now using the Google Finance API and is not compatible with the old add-in. Google Finance uses other ticker symbols. A new search dialog is now available and more data values can be retrieved. The old Stock Quote add-in was using the Yahoo Finance service to retrieve the stock quotes. The service seems to be terminated by Yahoo without any notice on 11/01/2017.

**Stock Quote Add-In For Excel 2016 and 2013**

The Stock Quote Add-In For Excel 2016/2013 is a small add-in based on the fantastic Excel-DNA library to retrieve stock data from Google Finance using the PSQ function.

**Usage**

The add-in is providing an Excel function called **PSQ** to retrieve stock data like open, last, low, high or name for the passed symbol. See the following formula samples:

* **=PSQ(A1;"PRICE")**, **=PSQ(A1;"CLOSE")**, **=PSQ(A1;"LAST")** or just **=PSQ(A1)**
* **=PSQ(A1;"OPEN")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"LOW")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"HIGH")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"LOW52")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"HIGH52")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"VOLUME")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"CHANGE")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"CHANGEPERCENTAGE")** or **=PSQ(A1;"CP")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"NAME")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"DATE")** => NOT last trade date, just date of last query
* **=PSQ(A1;"TIME")** => NOT last trade time, just time of last query
* **=PSQ(A1;"TICKER")** or **=PSQ(A1;"SYMBOL")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"EXCHANGE")**

DATE and TIME are the timestamp of the last query, not the last trade date. Google Finance API is not returning the this kind of data anymore.
