**Stock Quote Add-In For Excel 2016 and 2013**

The Stock Quote Add-In For Excel 2016/2013 is a small add-in based on the fantastic Excel-DNA library to retrieve stock data from Yahoo using the PSQ function.

**Usage**

The add-in is providing an Excel function called **PSQ** to retrieve stock data and a function called **PFX** to retrieve foreign-exchange rate data like quote or rate, name, date and time for the passed symbol. See the following formula samples:

* **=PSQ(A1;"PRICE")** or just **=PSQ(A1)**
* **=PSQ(A1;"DATE")** ==> ECT Time
* **=PSQ(A1;"DATELOCAL")**
* **=PSQ(A1;"TIME")** ==> ECT Time
* **=PSQ(A1;"TIMELOCAL")** 
* **=PSQ(A1;"NAME")**

* **=PFX(A1;"RATE")** or just **=PFX(A1)**
* **=PFX(A1;"DATE")** ==> ECT Time
* **=PFX(A1;"DATELOCAL")**
* **=PFX(A1;"TIME")** ==> ECT Time
* **=PFX(A1;"TIMELOCAL")**
* **=PFX(A1;"NAME")**
